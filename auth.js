     * passwords against a value in a database and for some other routes, you might wish to check the 
     * password against a value stored in a text file. In this case you can create 2 different strategies from the scheme.
     * 
     * scheme - the scheme name. A scheme is a general type of authentication. Basic authentication and digest 
     * authentication are different types of authentication and in hapi each would be a different scheme.
     * A scheme isn't used directly to authenticate users, instead you create a specific strategy from the scheme.
     * 
     * options - options based on scheme requirements.
     * 
     * Digest authenication communicates credentials in an encrypted form by applying a hash function to the
     * username, password, etc. The purpose of encryption is to transform data in order to keep it secret from others.
     * 
     * Basic authentication uses non-encrypted base64 encoding. Thus, basic authentication should only be used where
     * transport layer security is provided such as https. The purpose of encoding is to transform data so that it can
     * be properly consumed by a different type of system.
